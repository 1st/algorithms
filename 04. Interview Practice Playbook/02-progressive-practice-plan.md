# 02 · Progressive Practice Plan

Sustained interview prep benefits from deliberate practice: ramp difficulty gradually, cover diverse techniques, and track progress. Use this plan to structure four weeks of intentional study. Adapt the cadence to your timeline and experience level.

## Week 1 – Fundamentals Refresh
- **Goal:** rebuild intuition for arrays, strings, recursion, basic math
- **Daily focus:**
  - Day 1: Arrays & two-pointers (2 easy, 1 medium)
  - Day 2: Strings & hash maps
  - Day 3: Recursion/backtracking warm-ups (subsets, permutations)
  - Day 4: Simple dynamic programming (climbing stairs, house robber)
  - Day 5: Math & bit manipulation (parity, power of two)
- **Weekend:** timed mock (45 minutes) from easy/medium mix; review mistakes.

## Week 2 – Core Data Structures
- **Goal:** master lists, trees, heaps, hash structures
- **Daily focus:**
  - Day 1: Linked lists (cycle detection, merge two lists)
  - Day 2: Binary trees (DFS, BFS, level order)
  - Day 3: Binary search trees and balancing questions
  - Day 4: Heaps & priority queues (top-k, merge k lists)
  - Day 5: Hash maps/sets (two-sum variations, group anagrams)
- **Weekend:** mock interview focusing on tree/graph + array question.

## Week 3 – Advanced Algorithms
- **Goal:** consolidate dynamic programming, greedy, and graph techniques
- **Daily focus:**
  - Day 1: Greedy strategies (interval scheduling, coin change)
  - Day 2: Dynamic programming (edit distance, knapsack)
  - Day 3: Graph traversal (BFS/DFS, topological sort)
  - Day 4: Weighted shortest paths (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford practice)
  - Day 5: Advanced structures (trie usage, union-find, skip list conceptual review)
- **Weekend:** mock covering DP or graph + system design lite question.

## Week 4 – Interview Simulation & Refinement
- **Goal:** simulate real interviews, refine weak areas, build stamina
- **Daily focus:**
  - 2 alternating mock interviews (live or recorded) with feedback
  - Between mocks, retarget weaknesses (e.g., DP state formulation, communicating trade-offs)
  - Add behavioural question practice (STAR stories) each day
- **Weekend:** full interview loop (coding + system design + behavioural) with retrospectives.

## Tracking templates

### Daily log
```
Date | Focus Area | Problems Solved | Struggles | Next Actions
-----+------------+-----------------+-----------+-------------
2024-03-01 | Arrays | LeetCode 26, 80, 283 | Off-by-one in in-place removal | Revisit two-pointer patterns tomorrow
```

### Technique coverage matrix
```
Technique             | Easy | Medium | Hard | Last revisited
----------------------+------|--------|------|----------------
Arrays / Strings      | 5    | 7      | 1    | 2024-03-04
Trees / Graphs        | 3    | 5      | 2    | 2024-03-07
Dynamic Programming   | 2    | 4      | 1    | 2024-03-09
Greedy / Heaps        | 3    | 4      | 1    | 2024-03-08
```

Use the matrix weekly to spot neglected categories; ensure every technique gets attention at least once every 7–10 days.

## Problem sources
- **Core repetition:** LeetCode, HackerRank, CodeSignal (focus on company-tagged problems).
- **Timed mocks:** Pramp, interviewing.io, friends/colleagues.
- **Reference texts:** CLRS, “Grokking the Coding Interview”, “Elements of Programming Interviews.”

## Review cadence
- After every session, summarise lessons learned in <5 minutes.
- At week’s end, write a short retrospective: wins, blockers, adjustments for next week.
- Before interviews, skim your logs to remind yourself of past pitfalls and solutions.

Consistent practice with tracking builds confidence and reveals patterns in your problem-solving. Adapt this schedule to your constraints and keep iterating based on feedback.
