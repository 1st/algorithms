# 03 · Post-Interview Retrospectives

Every interview—successful or not—offers data. Decompress quickly, capture insights while fresh, and turn them into actionable improvements. This chapter provides a reflection template and follow-up guidance, plus tips for handling system design debriefs.

## Immediate cooldown (within 30 minutes)
- Take a short walk or breathing break to reset.
- Jot raw impressions: what went well, where you stumbled, interviewer signals.
- Resist the urge to over-analyse before collecting your thoughts coherently.

## Analysing feedback
- If recruiter shares results, note decision reasons (speed, correctness, communication). Adjust practice plan accordingly.
- If feedback is vague, infer from self-review and mock interviewer observations.
- Keep a running tally of recurring themes (e.g., DP state definition, clarifying questions) to prioritise future drills.

## System design reflections
- Diagram recall: can you recreate the high-level architecture you drew? If not, practise sketching again.
- Evaluation prompts:
  - Did you state requirements and constraints clearly?
  - How did you reason about scaling, consistency, and trade-offs?
  - Did you benchmark against real-world systems or prior experience?
- Action items: expand your design patterns notebook with the scenario you faced, alternative approaches, and open questions to research.

## Follow-up etiquette
- Send thank-you notes within 24 hours: brief, sincere, highlight an aspect you enjoyed discussing.
- If you realise you made a mistake mid-interview, you may acknowledge it in follow-up and provide corrected reasoning—use discretion, stay concise.
- Update recruiter on availability, competing timelines, or interest level after each stage.

## Long-term tracking
- Maintain a dashboard of interview outcomes with company, round, result, key lessons.
- Revisit notes before future rounds with the same company to avoid repeating mistakes.
- Periodically review progress to celebrate improvements and recalibrate goals.

Structured retrospectives convert anxiety into actionable learning. Treat every interview as a data point that refines your preparation for the next opportunity.
