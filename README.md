# Algorithms and Data Structures

**Algorithm** is a self-contained step-by-step set of operations to be performed. Algorithms perform calculation, data processing, and/or automated reasoning tasks. *Other definition is:* An algorithm is a sequence of instructions or a set of rules that are followed to complete a task.

In this small book you will find very concentrated and valuable information about algorithms and data structures. Knowing this information will help you to get the best job on the global market - you can pass interview to Google, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, and any other top company. Becuse **algorithms - is the main topic for all serious interviews**.

> **How does it work in a computer?** Low-level language is an Assembler, that operates with bytes and processor commands. Middle-level languages, such as C and C++, build on top of Assembler and it provides more rick language constructions *(variables, loops, conditions, functions, classes)*. And hight-level languages, like Python, build on top of middle-level language. On hight-level language you have a lot of built-in functions and language constuctions that do useful things.

> You need to know how do they work internally and how to use them properly. This book will help you to find answers on these questions.

In this book we will provide all samples of code in **python**.
