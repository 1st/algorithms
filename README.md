# Algorithms and Data Structures

**Algorithm** is a self-contained step-by-step set of operations to be performed. Algorithms perform calculation, data processing, and/or automated reasoning tasks. *Other definition is:* An algorithm is a sequence of instructions or a set of rules that are followed to complete a task.

In this small book you will find very concentrated and valuable information about algorithms and data structures. Knowing this information will help you to get the best job on the global market - you can pass interview to Google, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, and any other top company. Becuse **algorithms - is the main topic for all serious interviews**.

In this book we will provide all samples of code in **python**.
