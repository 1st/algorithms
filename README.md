# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository is a lightweight book for refreshing core concepts ahead of technical interviews. Each chapter focuses on a single idea, demonstrates it with Python, and closes with interview-ready checkpoints.

## How to use this guide
- **Warm up** with Part 01 to rebuild intuition before diving into problem drills.
- **Refer back** to the data-structure and appendix chapters when you need a quick reminder during practice.
- **Take notes** inside each chapter—treat this as a living workbook tailored to your learning style.
