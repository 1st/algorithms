# Usage of Algorithms

To learn something - you need to understand why you need this and where you can apply this knowledge.

Below we will provide some examples of code, that solve the same problem differently.
It will show you why one program can solve the same problem much faster than another.

And interesting thing - you don't need think that *"on C my program will work much faster than on python"*,
because if you write ineffective implementation on C - it will work much slower than good implementation
on Python. Just remember this.
