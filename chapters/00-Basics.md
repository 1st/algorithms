# `00` Basics of algorithms

**Why I need to study algorithms?**

> *Programming is the process of taking an algorithm and encoding it into a notation,
> a programming language, so that it can be executed by a computer. Although many
> programming languages and many different types of computers exist, the important
> first step is the need to have the solution. Without an algorithm there can be no program.*

**How does it work in a computer?**

> Low-level language is an Assembler, that operates with bytes and processor commands.
> Middle-level languages, such as C and C++, build on top of Assembler and it provides more
> rich language constructions *(variables, loops, conditions, functions, classes)*.
> And hight-level languages, like Python, build on top of middle-level language.
> With hight-level language you have a lot of built-in functions and language constuctions
> that do useful things.
>
> You need to know how do they work internally and how to use them properly.
> This book will help you to find answers on these questions.
