# `00` Basics of algorithms

**Why I need to study algorithms?**

> *Programming is the process of taking an algorithm and encoding it into a notation,
> a programming language, so that it can be executed by a computer. Although many
> programming languages and many different types of computers exist, the important
> first step is the need to have the solution. Without an algorithm there can be no program.*
